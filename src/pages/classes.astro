        Accessibility Information:
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
        Our main entrance has a high stair up from the sidewalk. Please let us
        know if you need an easier entrance to the building and we can open the
        roll-up door - this still involves a steep slope to enter and may not be
        appropriate for wheelchairs. Please let us know in advance if you have
        accessibility concerns, and we’ll do our best to accommodate.
